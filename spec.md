- [ ] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
- [ ] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)
- [ ] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)

- [ ] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)

Confirm:
- [ ] The application is pretty DRY
- [ ] Limited logic in controllers
- [ ] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [ ] Views use partials if appropriate

<%= f.fields_for :categories, @recipe.categories do |cat| %>
  <%= cat.label :categories %>
  <%= cat.collection_check_boxes :categories_id, Category.all, :id, :name %>
  <% end %>

Recipe Manager

1. Have at least one join table. This table should have each id from the other tables its joining as well as additional information like content, or permission

2. include validations in your models to make sure all information needed it inputted.

3. Scope method. So like a method giving us the overdue tasks. Use these methods to display different information. ** cooked a recipe changes the status. show all that have cooked . show all that havent cooked. show rating for that recipe.

4. Nested form with a custom attribute writer. this is initiated in our strong params. could use the accepts_nested_attributes_for method. 

5. devise authentication

6. faceboook login capability

7. nested resources. profiles/1/pictures/new. being able to create an item from inside another. 

8. display validation errors. Your fields should be enclosed within a fields_with_errors class and error messages describing the validation failures must be present within the view. Make sure to include those 3 sentences in the layout application for this. 

9. DRY!! Donâ€™t repeat. all logic in controllers is methods in your models. use partials in views.
