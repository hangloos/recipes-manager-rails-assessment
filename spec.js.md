Specifications for the Rails with jQuery Assessment

Step 1: Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend. For example, in a blog domain with users and posts, you might display the index of the users posts on the users show page, fetching the posts via an AJAX GET request, with the backend rendering the posts in JSON format, and then appending the posts to the page.

Notes - On the users home page. show all the recipes from that user. use ajax to get it and then convert the objects from active record to JSON to show on the page.
